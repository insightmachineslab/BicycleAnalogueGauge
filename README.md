# BicycleAnalogueGauge
Firmware and some resource files for the Utterly Hipster Bicycle Speed &amp; Cadence Gauges

This repository contains (in the Firmware directory) Arduino source code for a bicycle speed/cadence gauge that uses an analogue voltage meter to display speed or cadence values. The project is described in detail on its [Hackaday.io site](https://hackaday.io/project/26913-utterly-hipster-bicycle-speed-cadence-gauges). The repo also contains an SVG file with dial designs and a DIA file with electronic components connections diagram (in the Resources directory).
